# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to "Peruanista." This app is designed to provide real-time tracking of the internal transport bus within the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM). Your privacy is important to us, and this policy outlines the minimal data we collect and how we handle it.

## Permissions

The app only requests the following permission:

- **Location Access**:
  `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`

  This permission is required to show your real-time position on the campus map.
  We only access your location while the app is in use, and it is not stored or shared with any
  third party.

- **Internet Access**: `android.permission.INTERNET`
  This permission is required to access the real-time bus tracking data.

## Data Collection

### Fingerprint Generation

When you use "Peruanista," the app generates a fingerprint by hashing your device's unique identifier:

- **On Android**: The Android ID is hashed.
- **On iOS**: The "identifierForVendor" is hashed.

### Location Data

We collect your current location only when the app is open and actively in use.
This information is used exclusively to display your position relative to the bus route.
We do not store or share this data.

### Purpose of Data Collection

The generated fingerprint is sent to our server each time you access the application. This is done solely for **analytics purposes** to understand usage patterns and improve the app's performance. **No personal information is collected or stored**. **No interactions with the app are linked to any identifiable user**.
**We can not identify individual users based on the fingerprint alone.**

### No User Sessions or Authentication

"Peruanista" does not require user sessions or authentication to use the app. The app functions independently of any user credentials, providing 24/7 access to the bus tracking map.

## Notifications and News

"Peruanista" includes a carousel that displays university important updates. This content is purely informational and is not considered in-app advertising. It is intended to keep students informed about relevant updates and events within the university. No information of who sees or interacts with the notifications are stored.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or distribute any collected data to third parties. The data is used internally to enhance app performance and user experience.

## Security

We take the security of your data seriously and use industry-standard measures to protect it. However, please be aware that no system can guarantee complete security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the updated policy will be effective as soon as it is published.
